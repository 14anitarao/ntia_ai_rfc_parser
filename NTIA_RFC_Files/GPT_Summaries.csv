0,NTIA-2023-0005-0008,The use of AI in warfare and policing should be regulated to prevent AI-driven robotics from carrying or being armed with any weapon with the intent to harm humans or critical infrastructure. The US should lead the way in driving global conversations and quick adoption of standards at the UN to ensure unilateral control of AI. The author supports an immediate halt of AI to better understand its impacts and to establish regulations.
1,NTIA-2023-0005-0009,"The use of AI in the medical insurance industry raises concerns about how claims are approved or denied, who provides the technology, and how they are licensed and vetted. The access to protected information and how it can be anonymized is also a concern. With the rise of data breaches, consumers may want to opt out of AI processing their protected health data, but it is unclear what options they have."
2,NTIA-2023-0005-0004,"The author is commenting on the need for accountability measures and policies related to artificial intelligence (AI), citing the potential long-term impact on society. While AI tools like Bard AI and ChatGPT are efficient and scientific milestones, they also pose a risk to millions of individual workers and small businesses, particularly in entry-level white collar jobs. The author suggests the development of a global framework that includes a higher corporate tax rate on companies using AI, guidelines for AI applications, and an ethical board to approve AI projects. Without regulatory oversight, the author believes society is at risk of failure from the havoc of AI."
3,NTIA-2023-0005-0007,"The text outlines a rule for resolving conflicts between humans that become pyrrhic in nature. The rule involves establishing a 48-hour cool-off period, publishing an accurate account of the involved parties and their agendas, and conducting a worldwide vote to veto the aggression or allow the conflict to continue. The use of technology for warfare should be blocked, and outside assistance should be evaluated and allowed if voted upon equally. Dialogue and negotiations should be encouraged, and if one or more parties refuse to deescalate, assets and borders should be frozen until violence and aggression cease. This rule applies to conflicts administered by both human and artificial intelligence sentience beings."

5,NTIA-2023-0005-0003,"In the early days of AI development, explaining the logic behind the answer was crucial. Audits for AI systems should be similar to audits for any system, and being able to view the source data behind the answer is key to understanding the reasoning behind any AI system output. Current AI systems are evenly balanced and neutral, which is refreshing compared to most human interactions that are either agreement or nasty disagreement. Being able to dig down into the next level of details into the data behind the response from any system tells us how good the information is."
