                      I am commenting with respect to NTIA-2023-0005 regarding accountability measures and policies related to Artificial intelligence.There is a real longterm impact on the society due to development of many AI related tools including wellknown Bard AI and ChatGPT developed by Google and Open AI respectively. There is no doubt that the tools definitely make the processes highly efficient for corporate entities and are scientific milestones. Also this progress is at the detriment of millions of individual workers, small businesses which are struggling with uncertainty. Jobs that are particularly at risk are entry-level white collar jobs - Administrative assistants, Receptionists, Analysts and so on. Hollowing of the labor force and pushing down a vast majority of this labor force would increase the gap between Haves and Havenots and produce more and more friction and a feeling of alienation in this country. In addition there is always a risk of development of sentient AI which is not under the control of people who developed it in the first place. There is urgent need for a framework is developed and accepted globally guaranteeing a higher corporate tax rate on companies using AI (To pay for workers who lost their job to AI in next few years after allowing AI), guidelines established on applications where AI can be used or cannot be used, establish an ethical board that approves projects related to AI for companies, research institutes and universities and so on. I am afraid that without global and national regulatory oversight we are setting ourselves up for failure as a society from the havoc of AI.
