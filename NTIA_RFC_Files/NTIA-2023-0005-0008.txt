AI driven robotics should not be able to carry or be armed with any weapon, mechanical, biological, or digital, with intent to kill or maim humans or critical infrastructure upon which humanity is dependent. Furthermore, US regulations should drive global conversations and quick adoption of standards at the UN to assure unilateral control of AI.I support an immediate halt of AI to better understand its impacts, both positive and negative,  and to get regulations in place.
